# Current Phase

## Active Phase

Phase 1.5: Installable phone PWA

## Current Focus

- Repurpose this legacy Helper repo into Shipyard.
- Keep the first build static, mobile-friendly, and local-first.
- Explain Drop Idea, Workshop, You're OK, Saved Stuff, What Happened, and local controls on first use.
- Hide GitHub/dev wording from the main mobile UI.
- Add Send to Codi as a safe, prefilled GitHub handoff without storing tokens.
- Add Refresh from Codi to show open Shipyard tasks from GitHub without login.
- Blend refreshed Codi tasks into the Workshop Waiting lane instead of a separate block.
- Keep repeated Codi issues from showing as duplicate Waiting cards.
- Add a local Waiting card immediately when Dad sends an idea to Codi.
- Replace local sent cards with live Codi cards after Refresh from Codi.
- Send ideas straight through a local bridge when it is running.
- Send ideas through the Cloudflare bridge first for mobile.
- Make Shipyard installable from phone browser with a correct manifest, app icons, and service worker registration.
- Keep the GitHub issue form as a fallback when the bridge is unavailable.
- Show a clear local status when the Codi bridge is not ready.
- Add Windows scripts to start the local Codi bridge and install it at login.
- Preserve explicit approval flow before any future merge/deploy automation.
- Keep MGP visible in version/build information.

## Next Actions

- Verify Send to Codi creates a GitHub task from desktop and mobile.
- Decide whether to rename the GitHub repository from Helper to Shipyard.
- Wire Phase 0 cards to GitHub issues or pull requests only after the prototype feels useful.

## Permanent Version Rule

- Every version/build update must keep the letters MGP visible in the app's build or version information.
- MGP cannot be removed, hidden, renamed, or replaced during future updates.
